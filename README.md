*Project: Heart Disease Analysis (Power BI)*

🔭 **Purpose and Objective:**

This project aims to analyze medical data related to heart disease through an interactive dashboard in Power BI, designed to assess the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease based on variables such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and body mass index (BMI). The main goal is to transform  medical data into clear, actionable insights that support decision-making, raise awareness, and promote early prevention. It is worth noting that heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 18 million deaths annually.

📍 **Project Scope:**

This project aims to analyze medical data related to heart disease patients through a set of interactive analytical dimensions that help in understanding the patterns of occurrence and the influencing factors. The scope of analysis includes the following:

1. Demographic Differences Analysis: Studying the impact of gender, age, and physical factors on the likelihood of developing heart disease.
2. Lifestyle Analysis: Evaluating the effect of smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity levels on heart health.
3. Medical Indicators Analysis: Measuring the relationship between cholesterol, glucose, and blood pressure levels and the overall prevalence of heart disease.
4. Comprehensive Correlation Analysis: Building models that explain how different variables interact to identify the groups most at risk.
5. Interactive Dashboard Development: Designing a Power BI Dashboard to visually present the results, support data-driven decision-making, and enable fast and clear analysis of critical cases.
6. Patient Details Review: Providing a detailed, searchable view of individual patient records, allowing for the examination of specific cases and their complete data profiles.

🔎 **Sources and Tools:**

An Excel file containing real medical data was obtained from an open-source dataset available online. The following tools were used for the analysis:
- Power BI: for data analysis and creating interactive dashboards
- Power Query: for data cleaning and transformation
- Excel: for initial review and file organization
- DAX: for creating measures and calculated fields

Supervised by: Eng. Karim Baqli

📊 **Dataset Overview:**

The file contains real medical data for 68,206 patients collected from an open-source dataset available online. It includes 17 columns covering demographic, behavioral, and health aspects of the individuals. The data aims to analyze factors affecting the likelihood of developing heart diseases and to extract statistically significant indicators.

🎯 **Main Categories of Variables:**

- Demographics: Age, Gender, Height, Weight
- Lifestyle: Smoking, Alcohol consumption, Physical Activity
- Health Indicators: Cholesterol, Glucose, Blood Pressure
- Patient Details: Searchable patient records by ID
- Target Variable: The cardio variable indicates the patient’s condition (1 = affected, 0 = not affected).

🟰 **Statistical Overview:**

A preliminary statistical analysis was conducted to identify general trends and correlations among factors affecting heart diseases. The results showed the following:

- The age group between 45 and 60 years is the most susceptible to heart disease.
- A clear correlation was found between high blood pressure and Body Mass Index (BMI) with an increased likelihood of disease.
- Elevated levels of cholesterol and glucose were recorded among affected patients, while regular physical activity was a contributing factor in reducing risk.
- The results also indicate that most patients have slightly increased weight and higher-than-normal blood pressure, highlighting the importance of monitoring these indicators as key factors for predicting heart diseases.

🚩🚩**Conclusion:**

The phases of data collection, cleaning, and analysis have been completed, and the key indicators related to heart diseases have been extracted. The team is now preparing to move on to the development of an interactive dashboard to present the results in a more visual and analytical manner. Sincere thanks to the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and Supervisor Eng. Karim Baqli for their continuous support and guidance throughout the project implementation.
